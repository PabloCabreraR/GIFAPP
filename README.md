# GIFAPP

GIFAPP is my back-end project for the second module at the Ironhack's Wev Dev Bootcamp. I built it **mobile first**, and I hardly recomend to open it on a mobile or tablet. I've used many backend npm packages and modules but in resume I've used firstly Axios to connect with GYPHY's API; NodeJS and ExpressJs for the routes and server; Passport and BcryptJs for authentication; MongoDB for the data base and Handlebars and CSS3 for the Front.

GIFAPP is a complete functional web application where you can search for any GIF you want by just writing down a simple word in the searchbar and you get back a ton of GIFS. The best thing about my app is you can directly share with just one button any Gif you want. (via Whatsapp, Facebook, or linkeding) If that's not enough youi can also sign up and add your favorites gifs to your account toi be able to acces them more quickly when you need them. As i said before, it's been first created for mobile users, but you can also open it on tablet or desktop.
